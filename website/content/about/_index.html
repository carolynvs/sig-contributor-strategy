SIG Contributor Strategy is responsible for contributor experience,
sustainability, governance, and openness guidance to help CNCF community groups
and projects with their own contributor strategies for a healthy project.
    
We are a CNCF Special Interest Group that advises the Technical Oversight
Committee and CNCF projects on strategies related to building, scaling, and
retaining contributor communities, including governance, communications,
operations, and tools. We want to help grow flourishing, sustainable communities
with smooth journeys throughout their CNCF project lifecycle.
